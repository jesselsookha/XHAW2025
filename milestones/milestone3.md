## üìã Milestone 3 Briefing - Full Development

#### üîß **Purpose**

* **Goal:** Build the fully functioning website and mobile app based on the designs created in Milestone 2.
* **Key Focus:** Apply version control, professional coding practices, and maintain consistent UX/UI across both platforms.

#### üõ†Ô∏è **What You‚Äôll Be Submitting**

1. **Fully Functioning Web and Mobile App:**

   * Your final working website (HTML, CSS, JS).
   * Your final working mobile app (Android Studio or React Native).

2. **GitHub Repositories Showing Contribution History:**

   * Each group member is expected to show their active contribution using GitHub.
   * **Git Workflow:** Be sure to make commits often, push to your branch, and use pull requests to merge into the main branch.

3. **Consistent UX/UI Across Platforms:**

   * Both the website and mobile app should provide a seamless experience in terms of layout, colors, navigation, and functionality.

4. **Evidence of Collaboration and Task Tracking:**

   * You must maintain a **TimeSheet Document** to track each member's progress. This will help ensure that tasks are completed on time and responsibilities are clear.

5. **Professional Coding Practices:**

   * Ensure that your code is well-structured, commented, and adheres to industry standards.

#### üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë **Team Responsibilities and Collaboration**

* Regular team meetings (physical or virtual) to ensure progress.
* **Task Allocation:**

  * Each team member must contribute meaningfully to the project.
  * Ensure **clear task assignments** and hold one another accountable for meeting deadlines.

  If there are any issues with task neglect, report them immediately. These should be noted in the **peer evaluation** at the end of the project.

#### ‚úÖ **Checklist for Web & Mobile App Development**

---

### **General Guidelines:**

#### 1. **Navigation & User Experience (UX)**

* **Consistency in Navigation:**

  * Ensure the **navigation bar** is available on every page, both in the web and mobile versions.
  * For **mobile apps**, ensure that navigation is easy to reach (consider using bottom navigation or a hamburger menu).
  * The **back button** should function as expected on every page for both mobile and web. Make sure users can easily navigate backward without losing data.
* **Ease of Navigation:**

  * Keep the website and app intuitive. A user should be able to find what they are looking for without frustration.
  * Consider **multi-step navigation** or **nested pages** where needed. For instance, course pages should have a clear flow between course summaries and individual course details.

#### 2. **Responsive Design & Mobile Considerations**

* Your website must be **responsive**, meaning it adjusts correctly to different screen sizes (especially mobile and tablet).
* For mobile apps, ensure that the design is optimized for **different screen sizes** and orientations. Use **Expo Go** for testing across multiple devices.
* For both web and mobile, ensure that **images** are optimized for performance (compressed without losing quality) to avoid slowing down load times.

#### 3. **Typography & Consistency**

* Use **consistent fonts** across both platforms. If you‚Äôre using specific fonts (e.g., Google Fonts), they should be applied across all UI components.
* The font size should be appropriate for each platform (e.g., mobile screens usually require larger text for readability).
* **Hierarchy**: Make sure headings, subheadings, and body text are clearly differentiated using size, weight, and color.

#### 4. **Colour Palette & Aesthetic**

* Stick to the **colour palette** you defined in Milestone 2. This includes the primary, secondary, and accent colors.
* **Contrast**: Make sure the text is readable against the background. The colour contrast should meet accessibility standards (WCAG).
* Ensure that colors are **aesthetically pleasing** and complement the brand‚Äôs identity.

#### 5. **Positioning and Placement of Content**

* Follow the **layout strategy** defined in Milestone 2.
* Content should be organized logically. For example, course listings should be easy to scan, and **call-to-action buttons** should be placed prominently.
* For mobile apps, ensure that content fits within the limited screen size. Use **scrollable sections** where needed to avoid clutter.

#### 6. **Programming Logic & Functionality**

* **Functionality**: All pages and interactions should work as described. For example:

  * Dropdown menus must function correctly across all pages.
  * Course detail pages must load the correct information when selected (e.g., description, fees, course dates).
  * Calculating and displaying course fees should work as expected when users select courses.

* **Data Handling**: Use **JavaScript** for dynamic page content and **React Native** for dynamic mobile app content. Be sure to test the functionality thoroughly.

* **Error Handling**: Make sure that common errors (e.g., empty form fields, wrong input types) are caught and users are provided with **helpful error messages**.

* **SEO/Meta Tags**: Even for a mobile app, understanding the basics of SEO is crucial. Ensure that relevant meta tags are present for the website to improve search engine ranking.

#### 7. **GitHub Workflow**

* **Cloning Repos**: Each member should clone both repositories (one for web, one for mobile) and work within their own branch.
* **Commits & Branching**: As you work, make frequent commits to your personal branch. Once you‚Äôve completed a task, open a **pull request** to merge into the main branch.
* **Pulling the Latest Version**: Always pull the latest version of the code before you start working to avoid merge conflicts.
* **Collaboration on GitHub**: Provide clear commit messages, describing what was done (e.g., "Fixed layout issue on homepage" or "Implemented dropdown menu functionality").

#### 8. **Specific Page Functionalities**

* **Home Page:**

  * Ensure that all key elements (logo, menu, search bar) are visible and accessible.
  * The page should be responsive and display correctly on mobile and desktop.
* **Course Pages (Six-Month, Six-Week, and Specific Course Pages):**

  * Each course page should present the course title, description, schedule, and fees. For specific courses (e.g., First Aid, Life Skills, etc.), the information should be dynamically loaded based on the course selection.
* **Calculate Fees:**

  * Provide a clear way to calculate fees based on selected courses. Implement a user-friendly form for fee calculation and ensure the results are accurate.
* **Contact Details:**

  * Provide a simple form for users to send inquiries or contact the business.

#### üìù **Final Steps Before Submission:**

* **Cross-check your work:** Each team member should review the project to ensure all tasks are completed according to the checklist.
* **Ensure collaboration is evident**: Each member‚Äôs contribution should be clearly visible through GitHub commits and pull requests.
* **Testing:** Test both the website and mobile app thoroughly across multiple devices to ensure functionality and responsiveness.

### üîë **Important Notes:**

* **Peer Evaluation:** You will need to complete a peer evaluation where you will assess each member‚Äôs contributions. Be honest and constructive in your feedback.
* **TimeSheet Document:** This document will be submitted alongside your code and will track your time and task contributions.
