# 05 - Project Milestones  
## Tracking Progress from Concept to Completion

---

### 📌 Overview

The WIL project follows a structured series of **five key milestones**, designed to simulate the phases of a real-world client project. Each milestone builds upon the previous one, helping you develop your ideas from research through to deployment and final presentation.

> 🧠 _Each milestone is a checkpoint in your growth — as a team, as individuals, and as future professionals._

All submissions must meet **professional standards** and be submitted on time. **Late or incomplete milestones** may impact your final mark and group cohesion. Clear **team communication** and **accountability logs** are essential throughout.

## 🟡 Milestone 1 – Individual Research & Design Report

### 🎯 Purpose
Begin your journey by investigating the client's business and designing your **own interpretation** of a solution for both the website and mobile app. This milestone helps you practise user-centred design thinking and critical evaluation of your ideas.

### 📝 What You Must Submit (Individually)
- A **report** explaining your recommended design approach  
- Clear **motivation** for your design decisions and included functionality  
- **Wireframes** for both the website and mobile application  
- A **logo design** representing the business purpose and identity  
- Reflection of **user-centred design** principles in your work  

> 💡 _Take this seriously — your ideas from M1 could shape the final team product._

## 🟡 Milestone 2 – Group Design Consolidation

### 🎯 Purpose  
Bring individual ideas together. Evaluate and refine your team’s visual identity and user experience strategy. Work collaboratively to agree on a unified approach.

### 📋 Group Responsibilities
- Review and select the best logo from Milestone 1 **(or combine ideas into a new design)**
- Discuss and allocate **primary responsibilities** for each team member  
- Evaluate individual wireframes and combine the **best aspects** into final group designs  
- Produce final UI designs and wireframes for both platforms  
- Include clear notes on:
  - User interface structure
  - Button behaviour and page navigation
  - Colour palette, fonts, layout strategy
  - SEO/meta tags (basic)
  
> 📌 This is a **critical design checkpoint**. All future development must follow the decisions made here.

## 🟡 Milestone 3 – Full Development

### 🎯 Purpose  
Translate your designs into functioning digital products. This phase simulates the build phase in an actual client project.

### 🔧 Development Expectations
- Use professional development tools and version control (**GitHub**)  
- Develop both the **website** and **mobile app** according to the M2 specifications  
- Maintain a **consistent user experience** across both platforms  
- Conduct regular team meetings to:
  - Track progress
  - Flag issues early
  - Ensure task accountability

> 🧩 You will be held responsible for your assigned tasks. Consistent non-participation will affect individual marks and must be reported by the team.

## 🟡 Milestone 4 – Presentation & Demonstration

### 🎯 Purpose  
Communicate your team’s work with clarity and professionalism. Your presentation should not only **show what you built**, but also explain the **why** behind each design and development choice.

### 📽️ What’s Required:
- A **PowerPoint presentation** covering all major project areas  
- A **recorded video presentation** (can be edited from multiple clips)  
- A **live classroom presentation** using the same slides and structure  
- All team members must present a section in both versions

### 🎙️ Suggested Roles:
| Presentation Segment                              | Team Member |
|---------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| Web and Mobile Design Rationale                   | Member 1    |
| Logo Showcase and Brand Reasoning                 | Member 2    |

## 🟡 Milestone 5 – Reflection & Evaluation

### 🎯 Purpose  
End your project with structured feedback and self-awareness. The goal is to promote **growth, fairness, and critical thinking** about how you and your team worked together.

### 📄 Each Member Must Submit:
- **Self-Evaluation Form**: Reflect on your own contributions, strengths, and challenges
- **Peer Evaluation Form**: Provide fair and honest assessments of your group members

These evaluations will contribute to your **individual mark** and provide important insights for your lecturer. Discrepancies between team feedback and actual contribution may lead to **individual moderation** of marks.
