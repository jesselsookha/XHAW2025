# 03 - Design & Presentation Specifications  
## Guidelines for User Interface, Branding, UX Strategy, and Presentation

---

## 🎨 Overview

Your website and mobile application for **Empowering the Nation** must reflect a **professional, user-friendly, and purpose-driven interface**. The design must consider the needs of the target users: domestic workers, gardeners, and their potential employers.

This document outlines the visual, structural, and functional expectations for the final product. Your design decisions should be research-informed, culturally aware, and aligned with the client's goals.

> **Note:** Your work in the *Principles of User Experience Design* subject should inform your design process. Where possible, apply your UX research and assignments directly to this project.

---

## 🧭 Target Audience Consideration

Empowering the Nation's users are primarily:
- Adults from diverse educational backgrounds
- Job-seekers looking to improve their skills
- Employers or clients looking for professional training services

Designs should prioritise:
- **Clarity and simplicity**: Avoid clutter, use intuitive layouts
- **Legibility**: Use clean fonts and sufficient contrast
- **Cultural relevance**: Respectfully reflect the community being served
- **Trust and professionalism**: Consistent branding, tone, and structure
- **Mobile-first usability**: Many users may only access the mobile version

---

## 🎯 Define the Product Goals

Before designing, define what the platform aims to achieve. Document these clearly in your planning stages. Examples include:
- Make course information easy to find and understand
- Allow customers to request quotes effortlessly
- Encourage course enrolment and enquiries
- Promote the client’s mission and values
- Showcase credibility and community impact

---

## 👤 Create a User Persona

Develop at least **one user persona** based on your understanding of the client’s typical customer. Include:
- Name, age, occupation
- Motivations and frustrations
- Device usage habits
- Educational or digital literacy level

Use this persona to guide design decisions (e.g., font size, button clarity, menu simplicity).

---

## 🧾 Define Content Requirements

Identify what content the website/app must include:

- **Course listings and descriptions**  
- **About the organisation**  
- **Founder’s story / mission**  
- **Quotation request form**  
- **Contact details / location**  
- **Images, testimonials, and values**  
- **Pricing and discount breakdown**  
- **FAQs (optional)**

> Teams are encouraged to **expand and enrich** this content through research and classroom discussion.

---

## ⚙️ Define Functional Specifications

List and describe the key **functions** users must be able to perform:

| Function                            | Description                                                                 |
|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| View courses                        | Browse both six-month and short courses, with pricing and content summaries |
| Select multiple courses             | Choose more than one course and receive an automatic discount               |
| Request a quote                     | Submit a contact form or application for quotation                         |
| Access contact information          | Locate the organisation's phone, email, or physical address                |
| View programme structure            | See course durations and schedules clearly laid out                        |
| Read about Empowering the Nation   | Understand its history, vision, and social impact                          |

If you propose additional features (e.g., booking, login system), ensure they are justified and feasible.

---

## 🗺️ Information Architecture (IA)

Plan and document your proposed structure before development. Your IA should include:

- **Navigation flow** (top nav/menu layout)
- **Page structure** (hierarchies of content)
- **Labeling systems** (clear, non-technical names)
- **Wireframes or site maps** (low-fidelity sketches)

Your IA must be intuitive and support both website and mobile experiences.

---

## 🔁 Interaction Design

Consider how users will interact with your product:

- Button placements and feedback (hover, active states)
- Form usability (error messages, confirmations)
- Click/tap zones for mobile users
- Animations or transitions (if used, must be purposeful)
- Layout consistency across breakpoints (desktop/tablet/mobile)

Ensure these patterns are simple, predictable, and follow design system best practices.

---

## 🎨 Visual Design & Branding

While the client has no official logo, the brand should reflect:

- **Professionalism and care**
- **Empowerment and community upliftment**
- **Clean, trustworthy design**

### Font Guidelines
- Use clean, legible sans-serif fonts (e.g., Open Sans, Roboto, Montserrat)
- Avoid decorative or hard-to-read fonts
- Font size must be readable on mobile devices

### Colour Palette
- Consider calm, professional colours (e.g., blue tones, green tones for growth)
- Use contrast tools to test legibility (e.g., [WebAIM Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/))
- Limit use of bright or oversaturated colours

---

## 📱 Mobile & Accessibility Guidelines

- Use **responsive design** principles: your site/app must work across devices
- Test on small screen sizes and slow networks
- Support basic accessibility:
  - Text alternatives for images
  - Sufficient colour contrast
  - Clear headings and reading order
  - Keyboard navigability (for web)

---

## 🎥 Presentation Deliverables

### 🎞️ **Video Presentation (Official Submission)**
- **Length:** 5–8 minutes
- **Content must include:**
  - Introduction to your team and the project
  - Overview of research and design approach
  - Walkthrough of the web and mobile platform
  - Reflection on challenges and successes
- **Tone:** Semi-formal to formal
- **Format:** MP4 or other compatible format (check Arc guidelines)

> This video serves as both the **practice run** and official submission.

### 🧑‍🏫 **Live Presentation (Departmental Showcase)**
- Delivered during class to peers and lecturers
- Should follow the same structure as the video
- All team members must participate (speaking parts encouraged)
- Dress in a neat, presentable manner
- Be ready to answer questions about your design and decisions

---

## 📝 Documentation Expectations

Your **project README file** must include:

- Brief team bio and project overview
- Design decision justifications
- Persona and IA artefacts (wireframes, diagrams, etc.)
- Links to presentation video and hosted demo (if available)
- Tools used (e.g., Figma, frameworks, etc.)

Document as though you are submitting work to a real client or potential employer.

---

## ✅ Final Notes

- Apply what you are learning in your **UX course** here—connect the theory with real practice.
- Communicate clearly and maintain consistency across all design components.
- Use your class sessions and milestones as checkpoints to refine your user experience.

> *“Good design is not just how it looks, but how it works — especially for your user.”*
