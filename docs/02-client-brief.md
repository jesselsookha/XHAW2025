# 02 - Client Brief  
## Empowering the Nation ‚Äî Web & Mobile Application Project

## üè¢ About the Client

**Empowering the Nation** is a small- to medium-sized enterprise (SME) based in Johannesburg, founded by Precious Radebe in 2022. The organisation offers skills training for domestic workers and gardeners, aiming to empower individuals who historically lacked access to formal education and upskilling opportunities.

Precious‚Äôs motivation stems from her personal experience with her parents and elderly relatives, who were unable to pursue further education. This training school seeks to uplift similarly affected community members by improving their employability and enabling them to command higher wages or start their own small businesses.

## üéØ Project Overview

The client requires a **website and mobile application** that will:

- Advertise their business and course offerings  
- Allow potential customers (both employers and employees) to request information  
- Enable customers to receive quotations for selected courses  

The platform should present a professional image aligned with the client‚Äôs values, utilising appropriate fonts, images, and colour schemes.
