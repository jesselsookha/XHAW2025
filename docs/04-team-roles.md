# 04 - Team Roles, Collaboration & Timesheet Guidelines  
## Building a Team That Works Like a Company

---

## 🤝 Team Philosophy: Collaboration Over Division

In this module, working in a group is not just a requirement — it's a simulation of professional development environments. You are expected to work together **as a team**, not in silos. Although each member will have primary responsibilities, all team members must contribute across the development process.

> “You are not just building a project — you are learning how to work as professionals.”

## 👥 Primary Functional Roles

Each group of three must assign the following roles. These are **primary task leads**, not exclusive responsibilities.

| Role               | Responsibility Focus                   | Notes                                                                 |

## 📊 Timesheet / Activity Log

Each student is expected to maintain a **personal timesheet** as a transparent log of contributions. These will be reviewed alongside peer evaluations and final deliverables.

### ✅ Recommended Format

## 📁 Where to Store the Timesheet

- Format: Google Sheet, Excel, or Markdown
- Naming: `teamname_membername_timesheet.md` or `.xlsx`
- Store in: `/timesheets/` folder in your GitHub project repo

---

## 🧾 Peer & Self Evaluation (End-of-Semester)

At the end of the module, each student must complete:

- ✅ **Self-Evaluation**: Reflect on your contributions, strengths, and areas of improvement  
- ✅ **Peer Evaluation**: Assess your teammates fairly and honestly  

These evaluations contribute to **individual marks**, especially where contributions are uneven or unclear.

> 🛡️ Honest evaluations promote accountability. Ignoring issues within the group won’t make them go away — raise concerns early with your lecturer if needed.

---

## ✅ Final Notes

- Keep communication **open and professional**
- Support each other — don’t let one member carry the full weight
- Plan your meetings and tasks in advance
- Track your time and contributions consistently

> *“Successful teams are not just made of skilled individuals, but of people who show up, communicate, and care about the end result.”*
